## FAQs

### How do I customize this theme?

#### Easiest: Use [Obsidian Style Settings Plugin](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings)

This allows you to configure the theme directly in Obsidian without any CSS knowledge required!

More settings to come, but if you have specific requests, please [open an issue here](https://github.com/bencodezen/obsidian-night-owl-theme/issues/new)!

#### Intermediate: Add CSS snippets

Check out CSS snippets as a way to progressively enhance the theme.

Here's a [useful forum post](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/how-to-achieve-css-code-snippets/8474) to help get you started.

#### Hard: Create a fork of this theme

This is arguably the most reliable route, but will require some familiarity with coding.

I recommend using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) so you can leverage the [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) I'm starting to break out so you can make meaningful changes.

The Sass partials are will a work in progress though, so the way things are organized will probably change over time as I establish out better ways to structure how theming styles should be organized.

## Typography

### Preview Mode

When in preview mode, the typography is inspired by a dual font family system to easily distinguish between headings and regular text.

- Headings: [Rubik](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik)
- Body: [Karla](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Karla)

### Editor Mode

When in edit mode, the typography is inspired from a developer like environment where you're "coding" your second-brain.
