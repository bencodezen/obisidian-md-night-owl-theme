## 🛠️ Setup

### Step #1. Install Minimal Theme

1. Open **Settings** in Obsidian
1. Navigate to **Appearances** tab under **Options**
1. Under the **Themes** section, click on the `Manage` button
1. Search for `Minimal` in the Filter text input in the upper left corner
1. Click `Install and use` and you should now see your theme automatically switch!

## Step #2. Install Plugins for Minimal Theme Extension

1. Open **Settings** in Obsidian (if you closed it)
1. Navigate to **Community plugins** under **Options**
1. If needed, click on **Turn on community plugins**
1. Under the section **Community plugins**, click **Browse**
1. Search for `Minimal Theme Settings` and install it
1. Enable `Minimal Theme Settings` plugin
1. Search for `Style Settings` and install it
1. Enable `Style Settings` plugin

## Step #3. Import Night Owl Configuration File

1. Copy the contents of [obsidian-night-owl-theme.json]
1. Open **Settings** in Obsidian
1. Navigate to **Style Settings** under **Community plugins**
1. You should see four sections for `Minimal`, `Minimal Cards`, `Minimal Mobile`, and `Minimal Advanced Settings`
1. Click on **Import** in the upper right
1. Paste content from [obsidian-night-owl-theme.json]
1. Click **Save**

## Step #4. Match typography

If you want to match the typography in the theme, you'll need the following fonts on your machine:

- **Headings**: [Rubik](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik)
- **Interface**: [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter)
- **Text** (Body): [Karla](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Karla)
- **Monospace**: [IBM Plex Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Mono)

Except for **Headings** (which is managed by Style Settings), you'll need to update the font for **Interface**, **Text**, and **Monospace** in your Obsidian settings:

1. Open **Settings**
1. Click on **Appearance** under **Options**
1. Click on **Manage** for each respective section to add the desired font you want to use.
