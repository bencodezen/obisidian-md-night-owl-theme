## FAQs

### Is this still actively under development?

Absolutely. I'm still making theme adjustments as I continue to grow my own second-brain to improve readability.

### How do I customize this theme?

Simplest way is to modify the CSS directly, but this isn't a great experience in my opinion.

To make your life easier, I'd recommend using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) so you can leverage the [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) I'm starting to break out so you can make meaningful changes.

The Sass partials are will a work in progress though, so the way things are organized will probably change over time as I establish out better ways to structure how theming styles should be organized.

## Typography

### Preview Mode

When in preview mode, the typography is inspired by a dual font family system to easily distinguish between headings and regular text.

### Editor Mode

When in edit mode, the typography is inspired from a developer like environment where you're "coding" your second-brain.
